**Home Page:**

Idea taken from: <https://www.bradkorb.com/>

I like the robustness of this site but I don't like how busy it is. Too
much going on. I like a more simple design, like this site:
<https://www.bwgrealtygroup.com/>

Except that site, doesn't have any information. The only thing you can
do on it is submit a contact form, nothing else. I want something in
between these two websites.

Intro statement, home value search bar (homebot), process overview,
contact form

Intro statement, home search bar (mls, idx), search results (should only
have the listing agent's name and brokerage, not their contact info. Any

of where you are.
