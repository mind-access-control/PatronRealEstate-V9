                      how much time you have to get your home sold is very important. Having seen homes sell in as little 
                      as 10-15 days to as long as 5-6 months due to unstable buyers who tie up your property while 
                      continuing to fish around for other property or someone trying to wholesale your property while in 
                      escrow and under contract to buy your home. Are you prepared for these unforeseen obstacles and/or 
                      delays to sell?

                      and prepare yourself very early in the process, you will be able to make confident and favorable 
                      decisions. This also can help target the right buyers and reduce the back and forth that can happen
