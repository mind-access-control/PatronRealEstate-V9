      After years of intense competition and sky-high prices, the U.S. housing market is finally showing signs of relief for homebuyers‚Äîand the timing couldn't be better.

      According to a recent article from MarketWatch, housing inventory in the U.S. has climbed to over 1 million active listings, the highest level since before the pandemic. With more homes on the market and fewer bidding wars, buyers now have more room to breathe, think, and negotiate.

      üìâ Price Drops Are Back

      One of the most telling signs of this shift? Roughly 1 in 5 listings have had a price cut, and 37% of newly built homes are also reducing prices. Builders and sellers alike are adjusting to slower market conditions‚Äîand savvy buyers are reaping the benefits.

      üï∞ Homes Are Sitting Longer

      Another shift from the seller-dominated days of the past: homes are spending about 38 days on the market before going under contract. This gives buyers more time to view properties, do their homework, and even revisit homes before making an offer. Gone are the days of rushing in with a blind bid the same day a home is listed.

      üîç What This Means for Buyers

      If you've been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the market to cool down‚Äîthis might be your window of opportunity. While interest rates remain elevated, buyers now have more negotiating power, flexibility on terms, and the ability to avoid risky practices like waiving inspections or contingencies.

      üëÄ Local Perspective

      Here in Los Angeles, we're seeing similar trends, especially in neighborhoods where inventory is growing. If you're buying in areas like Altadena, Tujunga, Burbank, or surrounding parts of L.A., you may start to notice more listings with price reductions or seller incentives.
