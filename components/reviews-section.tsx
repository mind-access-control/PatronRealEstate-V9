      "I am so thankful we found Fabiola. She has an amazing work ethic and took the time to talk with us and listen to what we wanted. She helped us sell our family home of 55 years in Tujunga. Has local resources to help with estates sales, junk removal, plumbing problems, so many things that need doing to sell a home these days and she was on it! Very detail oriented and a great advocate. I highly recommend Fabiola Patron!",

      "I want to highly recommend working with Fabiola Patron if you're looking to sell your home or buy a home. She was truly a blessing to have on our team when selling my mother's townhome. Fabiola went above and beyond. She was there every step of the process. My mother's home was sold in less than two months from going on the market thanks to the dedication and commitment Fabiola provided. If you're looking for a trusting, professional, and dedicated realtor look no further. Fabiola Patron is the best!!!!",
